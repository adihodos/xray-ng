Endless TODO list:
- demo_base class seems kinda useless ??!!
- add frustrum debug draw 
- VulkanRenderer: handle swapchain suboptimal and out of date - done [x]
- Shader include support - done [x]
- VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer support: https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer.html
- GLTF support - partly done, need to add material support <<< done [x]
- shader printf support would be nice
- better asserts 

Lighting
 - direct [x]
 - indirect [x]
 - spot
 - PBR 

- make the UI work for Vulkan <<< done [x]
- revitalize the geometry generating functions <<< done [x]
- add function to generate a debug texture (XOR texture - https://lodev.org/cgtutor/xortexture.html) <<< done [x]

Scene:
 - SceneDefinition/SceneResources interact in weird ways, need to refactor a bit
 - support for GLTF/PBR materials << done [x]
 - graphs: can use this https://github.com/bobluppes/graaf [x]

Entities:
- need something better than what is implemented atm

Physics engine:
- JoltPhysics integration [x]
- basic debug rendering [x]
- support for DrawText3D (will also be usefull everywhere else in the engine)
